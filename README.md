Place the datasets (trainA and trainB) in the datasets folder within each of the model folders for vanilla CycleGAN, CycleGAN with better cycles and Bayesian CycleGAN. Now, follow the steps within each of the README files placed in these folders. For CycleGAN with better cycles, follow the instructions from the READMe in the following link-https://github.com/SsnL/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix. For DeblurGAN, create a directory with outputs from the above models. Now, add a path to this directory in the testing command specified in its README file.
